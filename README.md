# linkanpack
A datapack for Minecraft

For this datapack I uses some work of my own, and adapts some command block stuff for datapacks.

There will be some changes to loot_tables, recepis, and some functions. Right now a couple of recepis for red sand, gravel and normal sand are in, and a function to run faster on path blocks, and jump higher when standing on slime blocks.

I have added a function file for "Better armor-stands", which is a 1.13 datapack adaption of a commandblock system showed by Xisumavoid

Quite a few new recepies, eg glass blocks from panes and wood from slabs.

## Installation

Put the linkanpack folder into the datapack folder of the save game folder. Since the changes in 17w49b, there is no longer a need use gameloopFunction.

## Tools used creating this datapack
